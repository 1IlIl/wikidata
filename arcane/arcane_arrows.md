## Arcane Arrows

Arcane Arrows are a basic, yet unique spell in Arcanists 2. They follow standard arrow mechanics, curving towards the target. The multi-projectile nature can make these arrows somewhat difficult to maximize the damage on, however there are a few tricks to maximize damage or even take advantage of this challenge.

The multi-projectile nature of Arcane Arrows means that it can be useful for applying knockback to flighted players, such that they do not fall directly downward.

Something used at a high level, but that is not talked about much is how to aim “through” your opponent with Arcane Arrows. This is so that flighted opponents get continuously hit by your arrows.

Something not so logical is how Arcane Arrows are immune to Nature’s Wrath, but not shields like Flame Shield or Wind Shield.
